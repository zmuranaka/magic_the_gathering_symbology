## Getting started

First, import the library in one of your files.

```dart
import 'package:mtg_symbology/mtg_symbology.dart';
```

Retrieve an [MtgSymbol](https://pub.dev/documentation/mtg_symbology/latest/mtg_symbology/MtgSymbol-class.html) instance using the [mtgSymbology Map](https://pub.dev/documentation/mtg_symbology/latest/mtg_symbology/mtgSymbology-constant.html).
Then call its `toSvg` method to convert the `MtgSymbol` object into an [SvgPicture](https://pub.dev/documentation/flutter_svg/latest/svg/SvgPicture-class.html) widget.
