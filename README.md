## Getting started

First, import the library in one of your files.

```dart
import 'package:mtg_symbology/mtg_symbology.dart';
```

Retrieve an [MtgSymbol](https://pub.dev/documentation/mtg_symbology/latest/mtg_symbology/MtgSymbol-class.html) instance using the [mtgSymbology](https://pub.dev/documentation/mtg_symbology/latest/mtg_symbology/mtgSymbology-constant.html) `Map`.

```dart
final symbol = mtgSymbology['{W}']!;
```

Then call its `toSvg` method to convert the `MtgSymbol` object into an [SvgPicture](https://pub.dev/documentation/flutter_svg/latest/svg/SvgPicture-class.html) widget.

```dart
final symbolSvg = symbol.toSvg();
```

Finally, display it in your app like you would any other [SvgPicture](https://pub.dev/documentation/flutter_svg/latest/svg/SvgPicture-class.html) widget!

```dart
return Scaffold(
  appBar: AppBar(
    backgroundColor: Theme.of(context).colorScheme.inversePrimary,
    title: Text('Mtg Symbology Example'),
  ),
  body: SafeArea(
    child: Center(child: symbolSvg),
  ),
);
```
